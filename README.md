spark-hbase-client
==================


#### Overview

  Provides a Scala class for handling HBase connections and various
administrative actions. The class is intended for use within Spark executor
closures for proper HBase parallelism, but also wraps some administrative
functions for use by the driver, but care should be taken to not mix object
instances between the two, driver and executor.
